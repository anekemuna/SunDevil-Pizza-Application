# SunDevil Pizza Application

The SunDevil Pizza Application is a Java-based software solution developed as a group project for Arizona State University with the aim of simulating a comprehensive pizza ordering system. The application is developed using Java with JavaFX for the user interface. The software features a customer-facing interface for ordering pizza and tracking orders, as well as separate interfaces for chefs and order processors within the restaurant. The system follows the MVC architecture and utilizes a file system-based database for seamless data storage.

## Features

- Real-time order tracking to keep customers informed about the status of their orders.
